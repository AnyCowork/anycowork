# Skills System

Skills are the mechanism by which AnyCowork agents gain new capabilities. While "Tools" are low-level primitives (like reading a file or searching text), "Skills" are higher-level bundles of functionality that solve specific user problems.

## What is a Skill?

A Skill in AnyCowork is a package containing:

1.  **Metadata**: Name, description, triggers, and configuration.
2.  **Implementation**: Scripts (Python, Node.js, Shell) or native commands.
3.  **Documentation**: Instructions for the AI on how and when to use the skill.
4.  **Security Config**: Sandbox requirements and permission scopes.

Examples:
- **PDF Generator**: A skill that takes markdown text and converts it to PDF using a Python script.
- **Data Analyst**: A skill that uses Python's Pandas library to analyze CSV files.
- **Git Ops**: A skill to check status, commit, and push code.

## Sandboxing & Security

One of the unique features of AnyCowork is its **Docker-based Sandbox**. This allows agents to execute untrusted code (like Python scripts generated on the fly or downloaded skills) safely without risking your host machine.

### Execution Modes

Skills and Agents can operate in three execution modes:

1.  **Sandbox** (Recommended for most skills)
    - Code runs inside an isolated Docker container (`debian:stable-slim` or `alpine`).
    - The container has limited resources (RAM/CPU) and restricted network access (optional).
    - Your workspace is mounted, but system files are inaccessible.
    - **Requires**: Docker installed and running on the host.

2.  **Flexible** (Default)
    - If Docker is available, it uses the Sandbox.
    - If Docker is missing, it falls back to running on the host, but may warn or fail if the skill *requires* sandbox.

3.  **Direct**
    - Runs directly on your host machine.
    - Useful for skills that *need* host access (e.g., managing system services, accessing hardware).
    - **Security Warning**: Only enable this for trusted skills.

### Enforcing Safety

You can configure an Agent to **force** Sandbox mode via its Execution Settings. In this mode, if Docker is unavailable, the agent will refuse to execute skills rather than falling back to unsafe direct execution.

## Developing Skills

Skills are stored in the `skills/` directory (either bundled with the app or in your user data folder). A typical skill structure looks like this:

```
my-skill/
├── skill.yaml       # Definition
├── README.md        # AI Context & Usage Guide
└── src/
    ├── main.py      # Implementation
    └── requirements.txt
```

### skill.yaml Example

```yaml
name: "pdf-generator"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Converts Markdown to PDF using python-markdown and weasyprint."
execution_mode: "sandbox"
requires_sandbox: true
sandbox_config:
  image: "python:3.11-slim"
  memory_limit: "512m"
```
