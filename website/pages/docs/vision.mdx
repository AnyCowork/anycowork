## Vision: The Smart, Safe, & Optimized AI Coworker

**Goal**: To build the ultimate open-source AI coworker powered by **Gemini 3 Pro** that lives on your device, respects your privacy, and integrates with your entire workflow.

### Why Gemini 3 Pro?

AnyCowork leverages **Google's Gemini 3 Pro** as its default AI model because it offers:

- **Long Context Window**: 2 million tokens enable handling of entire codebases and long conversations
- **Multimodal Intelligence**: Native support for text, code, images, and more
- **Superior Reasoning**: Best-in-class performance on complex tasks and code generation
- **Cost Efficiency**: Excellent performance-to-cost ratio via Google AI Studio
- **Low Latency**: Fast response times for real-time collaboration

## Core Pillars

### 1. Smart: Capabilities & Extensibility

AnyCowork isn't just a chatbot; it's a proactive coworker.

- **SOTA Models**: First-class support for **Gemini 3 Pro** (default), **Anthropic Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.5**, and **OpenAI GPT-5**.
- **MCP Native**: Implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to connect to any external data source (GitHub, Google Drive, Postgres) without custom code.
- **Skills System**: Extensible "Skills" (directories with `SKILL.md` + scripts) allow users to teach the agent new workflows.
- **Agentic Architecture**: Uses a **Coordinator-Worker** pattern. The Coordinator plans complex tasks, and Workers execute them in parallel (future) or sequence.

### 2. Safe: Safety by Design

We prioritize user control and system integrity.

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical actions (file edits, shell commands) always require explicit user confirmation.
- **Granular Permissions**: "Always allow read-only", "Ask for write". Users define the boundaries.
- **Local-First Data Storage**: All conversations and configs stored locally. AI inference via trusted providers (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic).
- **Guardrails**: System prompts include strict safety guidelines to prevent accidental data loss.

### 3. Optimized: Performance & Efficiency

Built for the edge, not the server farm.

- **Powered by Rust & Tauri**: Extremely small binary size (under 20MB) and minimal RAM usage compared to Electron apps.
- **Fast Mode**: Instant responses for simple queries, bypassing the heavy planning agent.
- **Context Optimization**: Smart token management ensures long-running tasks don't blow up context windows or costs.
- **Robust Flow**: The event-driven architecture ensures UI responsiveness even during heavy agent tasks.

### 4. The "Coworker" Experience

- **Delegation**: "Here's a folder, fix the docs." → Agent plans → executes → reports back.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple specialist agents (Coder, Writer, Researcher) working together on the same task.
- **Natural Interaction**: Chat, Telegram, or future integrations (WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)

## Principles & Philosophy

### Local-First
Your data belongs to you. AnyCowork works offline and stores everything locally. Cloud features are **optional** and **encrypted**.

### Privacy by Default
No telemetry, no tracking, no data collection without explicit consent.

### Interoperability
Built on open standards (MCP, ACP) to work with any tool or service.

### Safety by Design
Human-in-the-loop by default. Agents ask before making changes.

### Performance Matters
Native Rust backend ensures low resource usage. Your AI coworker shouldn't slow down your computer.
