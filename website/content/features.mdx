# Features

AnyCowork combines the power of SOTA AI models with the safety and speed of a native desktop app.

## Smart

### Coordinator-Worker Agents
Complex tasks are too hard for a single prompt. AnyCowork uses a two-stage process:

- **Planner**: Breaks down your goal into steps (e.g., "Research topic", "Write draft", "Save file").
- **Workers**: Execute each step, reporting back results.

### Gemini 3 Pro Native
We optimize for Google's Gemini 3 Pro, taking advantage of its massive context window for deep document understanding.

### MCP Extensibility
Add new capabilities instantly by connecting [MCP Servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). From database access to git operations, the possibilities are endless.

## Safe

### Granular Permissions
You control the keys. Decide exactly which folders an agent can read or write to.

- **Read-Only Mode**: Default for research tasks.
- **Ask Permission**: The agent must ask before modifying files.

### Human-in-the-Loop
Critical actions like executing shell commands or deleting files always trigger a confirmation card. You can Approve or Deny every single action.

## Optimized

### Rust + Tauri
Built on the same tech stack as high-performance terminal emulators and editors.

- **Small Binary**: Tiny download, instant startup.
- **Low Memory**: Uses a fraction of the RAM of Electron apps.

### Offline-First
Your chat history, settings, and vector database live on your disk. You can view past conversations and search your local knowledge base without an internet connection.
