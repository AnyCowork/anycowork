# Introducing AnyCowork

**January 17, 2026** · 5 min read

We're thrilled to introduce **AnyCowork**, an open-source platform for building collaborative AI assistants that puts you in control.

## The Vision: Smart, Safe, Optimized

Building AI applications today often means choosing between power and privacy. AnyCowork refuses to compromise.

### 🧠 Smart
Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, AnyCowork agents understand your context deeply. The Coordinator-Worker architecture allows complex tasks to be broken down into manageable steps, executed efficiently.

### 🛡️ Safe
Your data belongs to you. AnyCowork implements **Safety by Design**:
- **Granular Permissions**: You explicitly grant access to files and tools.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical actions require your approval.
- **Local-First**: Data stays on your machine, always.

### ⚡ Optimized
Built with **Rust** and **Tauri**, providing a blazing fast experience with a minimal memory footprint. No more sluggish Electron apps eating up your RAM.

## Why AnyCowork?

### Multi-Provider Support
Switch between Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google with a single config change. Use the best model for each task without rewriting code.

### Local-First Architecture
Your data stays on your machine. SQLite-based storage means full control and offline capability.
