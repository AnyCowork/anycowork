# Introducing AnyCowork

**January 17, 2026** · 5 min read

We're thrilled to introduce **AnyCowork**, an open-source platform for building collaborative AI assistants that puts you in control.

## The Problem

Building AI applications today means:

- **Vendor Lock-in** - Tied to a single AI provider
- **Complex Infrastructure** - Managing servers, databases, APIs
- **Limited Flexibility** - Hard to customize and extend
- **Privacy Concerns** - Data sent to third-party services

## Our Solution

AnyCowork addresses these challenges with:

### Multi-Provider Support

Switch between Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google with a single config change. Use the best model for each task without rewriting code.

```python
# Easy provider switching
agent = Agent(provider="anthropic")  # or "openai", "gemini"
```

### Local-First Architecture

Your data stays on your machine. SQLite-based storage means:
- Full control over your data
- Works completely offline
- Easy backups (just copy the database)
- No cloud dependencies

### Federation Capabilities

Inspired by ROS2, our federation system lets you:
- Connect multiple instances across devices
- Distribute workloads intelligently
- Sync in real-time
- Scale horizontally

### Extensible by Design

Three ways to extend your agents:
1. **Native Skills** - Python-based tools
2. **Anthropic Agent Skills** - Cloud capabilities
3. **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol

## Who It's For

AnyCowork is perfect for:

- **Developers** building AI applications
- **Teams** needing collaborative AI tools
- **Researchers** experimenting with AI agents
- **Companies** wanting self-hosted AI solutions

## Open Source & Free

We believe AI should be accessible to everyone. That's why AnyCowork is:

- **MIT Licensed** - Use it however you want
- **100% Free** - No hidden costs
- **Community-Driven** - Built with and for the community
- **Transparent** - See exactly how it works

## What's Next

We're just getting started. Coming soon:

- Voice integration (wake word, speech-to-text)
- Live Canvas for visual collaboration
- Native mobile apps (iOS & Android)
- Skills marketplace
